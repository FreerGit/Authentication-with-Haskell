## Simply a backlog for features or bugs that are not prioritized ##

### Authie
- REMEMBER to change AUD claim when you know the address later on!

- Dire need of refactor, get functionality off the ground and then look at this repository:
https://github.com/dandoh/web-haskell-graphql-postgres-boilerplate

- I am not handling connection pools correctly, im starting a new pool on a new request...
I think...?? I think i should initialize the pool with the config and pass it around.

- Use jose library for JWT instead, supposedly safer??
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/jose

- unsafePassword type and Password type for non-hashed and hashed passwords.

- Cors is currently set to http://localhost:8080, this policy should be changed
if production or change in dev ports.

- JWT is signed with HS and not RSA atm
